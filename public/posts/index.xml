      <description>When entering a new subject area, inevitably one starts out as a beginner. There is a lot of content on the internet aimed at the beginner so you are probably asking now &amp;lsquo;how can being a beginner be bad?&amp;rsquo;, well the issue is not being a beginner in and of itself. It is more that people tend to self label as a beginner, seeking out content that is aimed at them specifically.</description>

      <description>For a long while now I&amp;rsquo;ve been interested in mechanical keyboards. But for the most part I hadn&amp;rsquo;t had the money to take part, boards tended to be expensive and as an unemployed student I needed to find something on the cheap. My first stop was a cheap ten keyless board from Amazon. It had some form of nockoff cherry blues. It was a good daily driver for the rather lengthy time I was using it but i decided it was time for change.</description>
