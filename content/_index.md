# Hi there

I'm Max, a software engineering appretice from the South East of England.

This blog will serve as a platform to document my journey into:
* programming
* free and open source software
* system administration and configuration
* FPV
* general life ramblings.

Feel free to take a poke arround and get in touch if you have any queries.
